# VaultGrid

## Project Description

VaultGrid is a decentralized smart contract-based vault system built on the Ethereum blockchain. It enables users to securely store their cryptocurrency assets with customizable time-lock mechanisms. Users can create personal vaults, deposit funds, and set time restrictions on withdrawals, providing a secure savings mechanism that prevents impulsive spending and protects assets from unauthorized access during the lock period.

The contract implements a simple yet powerful architecture where each address can own one vault with configurable lock times. This makes it ideal for savings goals, inheritance planning, or any scenario requiring delayed access to funds.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to democratize financial security by providing individuals with trustless, blockchain-based tools for asset protection and disciplined savings. VaultGrid aims to become the foundational layer for time-locked asset management, empowering users worldwide to take control of their financial future without relying on traditional banking institutions.

We envision a future where VaultGrid evolves into a comprehensive asset management ecosystem, supporting multiple cryptocurrencies, NFTs, and advanced financial instruments while maintaining simplicity and security at its core.

## Key Features

- **Time-Locked Vaults**: Create vaults with customizable lock periods to prevent premature withdrawals
- **Secure Storage**: Funds are secured by smart contract logic, eliminating custodial risk
- **Flexible Deposits**: Add funds to your vault at any time without resetting the lock timer
- **Partial Withdrawals**: Withdraw any amount from your vault once the lock period expires
- **Transparent Operations**: All transactions are recorded on-chain with event emissions for easy tracking
- **Gas Efficient**: Optimized contract design minimizes transaction costs
- **Self-Custody**: Users maintain complete control over their private keys and assets

## Future Scope

### Phase 1: Enhanced Functionality
- Support for multiple vaults per address with unique identifiers
- Emergency withdrawal mechanism with penalty fees
- Vault beneficiary designation for inheritance planning
- Extendable lock periods without fund withdrawal

### Phase 2: Advanced Features
- Multi-signature vault management for shared savings
- Interest-bearing vaults through DeFi protocol integration
- Scheduled recurring deposits with automation
- NFT and ERC-20 token storage capabilities
- Vault transfer functionality between addresses

### Phase 3: Ecosystem Expansion

- Mobile and web application interface
- DAO governance for protocol upgrades
- Integration with hardware wallets
- Analytics dashboard for vault performance tracking
- Social recovery mechanisms for lost keys

### Phase 4: DeFi Integration

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v14+ and npm
- Hardhat or Truffle development framework
- MetaMask or similar Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
npm install --save-dev hardhat @nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox
```

### Deployment

```bash
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat deploy --network <network-name>
```

### Testing

```bash
npx hardhat test
```

## Usage Example

```javascript
Deposit additional funds
await vaultGrid.deposit({ value: ethers.parseEther("0.5") });

Withdraw after lock expires
await vaultGrid.withdraw(ethers.parseEther("0.5"));
```

## Security Considerations

- Always verify the lock time before creating a vault
- Store your private keys securely
- Audit the contract before deploying to mainnet
- Consider using a multisig wallet for large deposits
